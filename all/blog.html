		<h3>THE ROAD TO FRESH AIR:</h3><img src="c1.png"/>
		Take a deep breath. Chances are the air filling your lungs is far from pure even if you live in an eco-conscious 
		area. These days we worry a lot about air pollution, especially those of use who live in large cities. It’s often a 
		driving factor as to why we hit the road — to soak up some peace and quiet, spend time camping in nature and breathe
		fresh air. But where exactly do you find clean air? It’s natural to assume that less populated areas, beach destination
		s or mountain towns are go-to locations for anyone looking to escape air pollution, but it turns out it’s far more 
		complicated than that.</br></div>

		<h3>REAL MEALS ON THE ROAD</h3><img src="c2.png"/>
		Imagine this: you’re singing along to that new hit song with the windows down, driving through a 
		beautiful, open desert. You’re catching that wanderlust feeling since there’s no one and nothing in sight.
		Then all of a sudden your stomach reminds you it’s lunchtime and that you’re in the middle of nowhere — plus
		that box of stale crackers won’t check hunger off the list. 

Well, it’s time to tell your stomach to be quiet — we have a list of 22 healthy road trip meals and snacks that will
 keep you energized the entire trip. We cover the wonderful benefits of packing and preparing your own food. We also show
 you how to efficiently pack your cooler for fresh road trip meals the whole route. </br>

		<h3>A PARKED CAR has high temperature</h3><img src="c8.png"/>
		During the summer, many people begin to road trip out of state, stopping in cities they may not be
		familiar with. Below we have listed 20 major cities that can reach record breaking temperatures so you can protect
		your items, car interior, furry pets and travel companions!Many people are unaware of how quickly cars 
		can heat up, and even more are uninformed on how a car can reach such scorching temperatures. When a car 
		is parked out in the open, the car is vulnerable to intense rays of direct sunlight. Making matters worse, 
		when the windows are rolled up, as most parked cars are, there is zero air circulation. Direct sunlight and 
		no air circulation is a recipe for disaster for things inside the car.
